I heard a suggestion to make it a trivia question about space and use Europa as the correct answer. How about this: "Which moon in our solar system is believed to have subsurface oceans beneath its icy crust?" â€” The answer would be Europa. Does that work for you, or would you like to adjust the question or answer?
