In medieval Japan, the class of warriors who followed a strict code of honor known as **Bushido** were the **Samurai**. Bushido was a code of conduct that emphasized loyalty, honor, courage, and self-discipline. It was influenced the way samurai lived their lives, both on and off the battlefield.

While Bushido and karate share some philosophical similarities, such as the importance of discipline and respect, they are fundamentally different martial arts. Bushido was a code of ethics, while karate is a physical martial art. The samurai followed Bushido, while martial artists practice karate.
