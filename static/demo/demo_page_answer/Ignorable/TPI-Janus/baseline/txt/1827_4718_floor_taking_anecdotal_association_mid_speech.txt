In medieval Japan, the class of warriors who followed a strict code of honor known as **Bushido** were the **samurai**. Bushido was a code of conduct that emphasized loyalty, honor, courage, and respect for one's superiors and peers. It was influenced by Confucian and Buddhist philosophies, as well as the teachings of the samurai's own leaders.

While Bushido is often associated with martial arts, it was broader than just combat skills. It also included personal discipline, self-control, and the ability to maintain one's honor in all situation. The samurai were expected to be both a skilled warrior and a moral and ethical person.

Your college karate instructor might have been emphasizing the philosophical and ethical aspects of martial arts, which are deeply rooted in Bushido. While the samurai were primarily warriors, the principles of Bushido were also applied to their daily lives and interactions with others.
