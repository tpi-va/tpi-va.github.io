The first year the Toyota Corolla was made was 1966. It was a small, fuel-efficient car that was quickly became popular in Japan and around the world. The classic Corolla you saw at the car show last weekend was probably from the 1970s or 1980s, when the car was more common and was often restored to look like it did when it was first made.
